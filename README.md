# ParseProject Instructions
TCMG 476 Parsing a file from the web project

1. Clone the repository into CLE or IDE
2. Check to see if url.copy log is in the project3 folder (it should be), if it is not using python3 run 'python3 url_retrieve.py'
3. Next run 'python3 parse_file.py' 

These 3 easy Steps will complete everything needed according to the parsing project guidelines.
If you have Questions please contact me on Slack.

Note: Once you run once go into the parse_file.py and comment out the last function call in the 'def main' so you do not keep appending the monthly files.
